## Phase 1

> To Do List Manager Phase 1: Incorporate configuration settings to the application

#### In Phase 1, we’re going to perform some refactoring of the To Do application as built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

### Deployment on sandbox :

## Phase 2

> To Do List Manager Phase 2: Incorporate configuration settings to the application

#### In this phase, we’ll be adding an editor so that users can save their preferences for the application, allowing them to change some of the default behaviors

## Phase 3

> To Do List Manager Phase 3: Adding security and access controls to the application.

#### In this final phase, we’ll be requiring that users be logged in, in order to see the to do items.

### Additionally, based on their user type, they will be allowed (or denied) to perform actions such as editing or deleting them.
